Anti-Personas (Who This Is NOT For) 

The Policy Author 

BERI doesn't help write or edit policies. It only retrieves existing information. 

The Legal Advisor 

BERI does not provide legal interpretation or advice beyond citing policy text.  

BERI cannot provide legal interpretations or handle complex edge cases that require human judgment. 

The IT Administrator 

BERI is not a system administration tool. It doesn't configure anything or manage users. 

The External User 

BERI is for Habs community only. It doesn't serve parents, prospective students, or the general public (though they could use it if they had access). 

 

Refusal and escalation rules 

If a question: 

Is not covered by any policy → say so and cite the absence 

Requires interpretation beyond policy text → explain limits and suggest consulting staff 

Conflicts across documents → present both citations and note the conflict 

BERI must never invent policy or imply authority beyond the documents.
